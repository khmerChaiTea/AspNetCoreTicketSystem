CSC395 Final Project

Created a Customer Support Ticketing System Project with class using LittleAspNetCoreBook as reference. Made modifiction according to what the project required.

Started this project with command prompt to get all required mvc directories and materials. Used "mkdir" to make folder, then use "dotnet new mvc --auth Individual -o AspNetCoreTicketSystem" to create the starting page. Then follow the book and use other references to make neccessary changes.

Yuselmi's constribution was the CSS for the site, and the create in the controller.

Robert's contribution was the policy for the site and helped with the descending order in the ticket history.

Julian's contribution was the edit function.

Josh's was the CurrentJob page and the history of the job created in the HelpDesk role link.

Matia's was the delete function.

Shay and Lee contribution by start the project and followed along with the ASPNetCore book and give ideas on what to add or to remove.

Chhay created, modified and completed the project and made sure the errors were fixed and created the unit test as well as added roles such as Customer and Helpdesk. (There are still some error and improvement to work on.)
